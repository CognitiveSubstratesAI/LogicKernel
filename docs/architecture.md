# LogicKernel architecture

## The layout mirrors swipl-devel

Decided 2026-10-02: LogicKernel is a **full mirror** of [swipl-devel](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel)
(first priority) with [scryer-prolog](https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog) as the second reference,
so comparing with upstream — and tracking it commit by commit — stays a mechanical job.

| upstream | LogicKernel |
|---|---|
| swipl-devel `src/pl-prims.c` | `src/pl-prims.jl` |
| swipl-devel `boot/tabling.pl` | `boot/tabling.jl` |
| swipl-devel `tests/core_lang/test_bips.pl` | `test/core_lang/test_bips.jl` |
| scryer-prolog `src/lib/tabling.pl` | `scryer-prolog/src/lib/tabling.jl` |

* A ported **file** lives at upstream's path; a ported **function** or **test unit** keeps upstream's
  name (`!` appended when it mutates an argument). Each carries a `# PORT:` marker.
* Code with **no upstream counterpart** opens with `# ORIGINAL: <why>` and lives in the nearest SWI
  area: `src/` for source, `test/<SWI tests area>/` for its tests, `test/` root for package
  infrastructure. It may never sit at a path that shadows an upstream file, and never in `boot/`.
* Directories exist only where swipl-devel has them.

`tools/port_check.jl` enforces every rule above in the suite (with a fixture proving each check can
fail), and the workspace hook `require-logickernel-port-header.sh` catches the common mistakes at
write time. The generated table in [`port_inventory.md`](port_inventory.md) lists every port;
`tools/upstream_drift.jl` reports what changed upstream since each one.

**Where Julia forces a different name** (the only deviations, each required by the language):

| swipl-devel | LogicKernel | why |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/` | `test/` | `Pkg.test` runs `test/runtests.jl` |
| `tests/test.pl` (driver) | `test/runtests.jl` | same |
| — | `src/LogicKernel.jl` | a package's entry file must be `src/<Name>.jl` |
| — | `ext/` | Julia package extensions |
| `doc/`, `man/` | `docs/` | Julia documentation convention |

## What is here now

| file | what | upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `src/term_interface.jl` | the term interface (ORIGINAL — settled 2026-10-02) | — |
| `src/pl-prims.jl` | the standard order of terms: `compareStandard` and its chain | `src/pl-prims.c`, `src/pl-incl.h` |
| `src/default_term.jl` | `Term{G}`, the reference implementation (ORIGINAL) | — |
| `test/core_lang/test_bips.jl` | SWI's own `ground/1`, `compare/3`, `==/2` tests | `tests/core_lang/test_bips.pl` |
| `test/core_lang/test_compare_swipl.jl` | live differential: `compare/3` on every pair vs `swipl` | — |
| `test/core_lang/test_term_interface.jl` | the conformance suite on the reference type | — |

## Subsystems — a grouping of upstream files, not directories

The kernel is built in this order; each subsystem is the set of SWI files it ports. An arrow reads
"depends on".

    unify --> terms
    constraints --> unify

    trie --> unify
    index --> terms
    db --> terms

    tabling --> trie
    tabling --> db
    vm --> unify
    vm --> constraints

```

| subsystem | port class | swipl-devel files | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `terms` | design + code | `src/pl-prims.c` (standard order) | the interface is ORIGINAL; compounds are children with the head as child 1 |
| `unify` | code | `src/pl-variant.c`, `src/pl-termhash.c`, unification in `src/pl-prims.c` | variant checking, term hashing, renaming |
| `constraints` | code | `src/pl-attvar.c` | attributed-variable hooks |
| `trie` | code | `src/pl-trie.c` | answer and variant tables, variables keyed by first occurrence |
| `index` | code (assessment) + design | `src/pl-index.c` | see the contract below |
| `db` | design | `src/pl-proc.c` | clauses in source order, generations (logical update view), clause GC |
| `tabling` | code (WFS) | `src/pl-tabling.c`, `boot/tabling.pl`; scryer `src/lib/tabling.pl` | SLG: suspension, SCC completion, WFS delays; scryer's is the delimited-control design |
| `vm` | design | `src/pl-comp.c`, `src/pl-wam.c` | SWI is ZIP-based, not the WAM; compiled clauses decompile back to terms |

## Invariants every subsystem keeps

1. **Indexing never changes answers.** Any narrowing yields a superset; enumeration yields exactly
   the true multiset, in source order. A flag that disables narrowing must disable EVERY narrowing.
   SWI's deep (nested-argument) indexing returns from the functor sublist without visiting the
   variable-clause sublist; where every clause fires, the two must be UNIONED.
2. **A grounded key follows `==`.** Where `==`, `isequal` and `hash` cannot be guaranteed to agree,
   the key is `nothing` — a wildcard, never a shared bucket. `gnd_equal` is the only grounded
   comparison in the kernel.
3. **Answers in order, duplicates kept.** Deduplication and tabling modes are caller options.
4. **No module-level mutable state** (`tools/lint_globals.jl`, run by the suite).
5. **No runtime dispatch, no abstract fields, no `Any`** — enforced by the suite with JET, Aqua,
   AllocCheck and the type-discipline gates; every method must be in the dispatch manifest.
6. **No choice points, no trail.** Nondeterminism is sink/continuation with an explicit stack.
7. **Standalone.** No dependency on any CognitiveSubstratesAI package.

## Still to come

* **The standalone consumer** — a small client program (benchmark programs or a Datalog example)
  using only `DefaultTerm` and the public API. It must exist before the index lands: until something
  other than one client exercises the interface, "standalone" is a claim about `Project.toml`.
* **The canonical-encoding property** — the kernel's variant key of a term equals MORK's De Bruijn
  bytes for it. It arrives with variant canonicalisation (`unify`) and a PathMap extension.
